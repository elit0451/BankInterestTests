# Bank Interest Rate Tests :bank:

This repository contains a **Unit test assignment** implemented in Java <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/java-43-569305.png" height="25" align="center"> using <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/874086?s=400&v=4" height="35" align="center">, including a solution to the following bullet points:

<br/>

https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/
1. Implement the following bank interest example :symbols: : <br/>
>      A savings account in a bank earns a different rate of interest depending on the balance in the account
>      A balance in the range $0 up to $100 has a 3% interest rate
>      A balance over $100 and up to $1000 has a 5% interest rate
>      A balance of $1000 and over have a 7% interest rate

2. Implement tests for the following method:
`public double calculateYearlyInterest(Account account)`

3. Implement a test that uses at least :eight: different assertions;

4. Rename the **8 different assertions test** with an annotation and verify :white_check_mark: the test has been renamed _(a duplicate of the above test has been made)_;

5. Set up an random Boolean and an assumption that the Boolean is true in the **8 different assertions test** and
verify the test skips when the assumption is not met _(a duplicate of **3.** has been made)_;

6. Make the **8 different assertions test** sleep :zzz: for 8 seconds and set an assert time out :hourglass_flowing_sand: to 5 seconds and verify the test fails :x: _(a duplicate of **3.** has been made)_;

7. Use a lambda in the **8 different assertions test**, that first prints :fax: a _System out_ message and then returns the
same message as assertion message;

8. Use `assertAll` for the **8 different assertions test** _(a duplicate of **3.** has been made)_;

9. Disable the **8 different assertions test** with annotation and verify the test has been **disabled** _(a duplicate of **3.** has been made)_;

~~10. Implement your own launcher capable of executing the tests and extracting the results for the bank interest
example~~ (This point wasn't implemented:heavy_exclamation_mark:);

The class containing all the tests can be found :flashlight: in [JavaTest.java](./src/test/java/com/cphbusiness/testassignment2/JavaTest.java). <br/>
If you are interested in the Bank Logic look :eyes: into the first [testassignment2](./src/main/java/com/cphbusiness/testassignment2) folder.
